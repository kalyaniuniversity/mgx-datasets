## DLBCL / FL Dataset

---

> This classification model is built with probably the most famous gene expression cancer dataset (Golub et al.), containing information on gene-expression in samples from human acute myeloid (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). The original research is one of the first to show a new approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays.
